1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
The purpose of a breakpoint is to define where to stop the normal execution of
the application and start the debugging session.


2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, the program stops before the breakpoint-line execution.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
If we "step over", the debugger executes the current line and stops at the next.

4. What does the step into command do?
The "step into" command goes to the start of the code that is being called in
the current line (e.g. a method in a class) and stops there.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
"Evaluate expression" gives the result of a single line of code (which does not
need semicolon); "Evaluate code fragment" allows to write multiple lines of code
in it, separated by semicolons as normal, and execute them.
